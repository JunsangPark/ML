# Machine Learning(ML)-Algorithm

+ **Classification**
   - Linear regression
   - Logistic regression 
   - Naive Bayes
   - Support Vector Machine(SVM)
   - Decision tree 
        + impurity, information gain
   - Random Forest
        + feature bagging
   
+ **Clustering**
   - k-means clustering 
        + cost value or distortion, elbow method
   - Power iteration clustering : spectral clustering
   - Gaussian mixture model 
   - Latent Dirichlet allocation(LDA)

+ **Algorithm**
   - Optimal stopping 
        + Secretary problem : 
            - no-information game : 37 percent rule
            - full information game : using threshold rule, 58 percent rule
        + Burglar problem     
   - Explore/Exploit
        + Multi-armed bandit problem :
            - Win-stay, Lose-shift algorithm by Herbert Robbins(1952)
            - The theory of dynamic programming by Richard Bellman(1954)
            - Gittins Index algorithm: discounting. But, various experiments in behavioral economics and psychology suggest that people do not act that way. And it is difficult to calculate gittins index immediately. 
            - "Asymptotically efficient adaptive allocation rules" by Lai and Robbins(1985)
            - Upper Confidence Bound algorithm : minimal regrets. This is the way to choose the alternative with the highest confidence limit.
